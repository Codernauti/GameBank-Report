Games are an instrument for entertainment and socialization. As described 
in~\cite{gee03}, a game in order to keep its user amused needs to:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*)]
 \item have a learning curve not too steep
 \item continuously give informations and hints
 \item remain challeging during the gameplay without being too much difficult
 \item engage the player as a ``producer'' and not only as a ``consumer''.
\end{enumerate*}
In this context, board games can result sometimes in long and mechanical 
operations that could ruin the overall gameplay. Pervasive games partially 
solves this issues providing digital instruments to speed up repetitive 
tasks and improving the game experience. This creates a new, immersive, 
gameplay opportunity preventing further burden.
As said in~\cite{mandryk02} different attemps of merging board games with video 
games already exists, and it is proved that there are advantages.
With these characteristics, GameBank enables board games to become pervasive 
games, adding the virtual component needed~\cite{arango17}. 
In this way, GameBank blends real and digital experience in only one.
