Playing games can be a social activity, especially when playing board ones. 
Sometimes, though, the fun can be reduced by the burden of managing the 
game itself by a master, that has to take in consideration the actions of 
everyone and act accordingly to the game mechanics. Recently, a new  concept of 
gaming developed, called pervasive gaming, that allow existing games to be 
augmented by applications, resulting in a blend of the real and virtual worlds 
~\cite{arango17} like, for example, Nintendo Labo does.
The virtualization improves the gameplay, making it easier to manage, even if 
there is always the need of a master~\cite{bjork01}.
For some activities, this role can be distributed to the members, spreading its 
duty to everyone. An activity that can be easily distribued, for example, is the 
one where there are transaction of in-game money. The distribution of this task 
can be performed in the same way Blockchain works: every memeber can emit a 
transaction and all the other peers have the possibility to check it and to 
determine its validity. This open up to a whole new type of possibilities, where 
new technologies, implemented as pervasive games, could be tested to real use 
case.

Most of the time, players are located in the same room when playing board 
games. This particular disposition makes an already established technology in 
the market, Bluetooth, an optimal solution to implement these applications. In 
our report, we will talk about GameBank, an example of pervasive game that, 
thanks to this wireless link, allows player to distribute the role of a Bank in 
monopoly-like games in a piconet.\\

\todo{Set the correct references} This paper is organized as follows: Section 
CHANGEME describes how pervasive games and distribution of mastering duties can 
improve overall gameplay, while Section CHANGEME provides XXX\todo{Set what 
this section will talk about}. Section CHANGEME describes how the application 
is designed and implemented, while Section CHANGEME lists the problems we faced 
while developing our application. Finally, in Section CHANGEME we analize some 
metrics results about Bluetooth and in Section CHANGEME we propose some future 
developments for our application. Finally, Section CHANGEME provides conclusions 
about our work.
