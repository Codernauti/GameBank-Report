Playing games can be a social activity, especially when playing board ones. 
Sometimes, though, the fun can be reduced by the burden of managing the 
game itself by a master, that has to take in consideration the actions of 
everyone and act accordingly to the game mechanics. Recently, a new  concept of 
gaming developed, called pervasive gaming, that allow existing games to be 
augmented by applications, resulting in a blend of the real and virtual worlds 
~\cite{arango17}.
This virtualization improves the gameplay, making it faster and easier to 
manage. Anyway, there is always the need of a master. For some activities, this 
role can be distributed to the members, spreading its duty to everyone. An 
activity that can be easily distribued, for example, is the one where there are 
transaction of in-game money. The distribution of this task can be performed in 
the same way Blockchain works: every memeber can emit a transaction and all the 
other peers have the possibility to check it and to determine its validity.
