Playing games can be a social activity, especially when playing board games. 
Sometimes, though, the fun can be somehow reduced by the burden of managing the 
game itself by a master, that has to take in consideration the actions of 
everyone and act accordingly to the game mechanics. Recently, a new  concept of 
gaming developed, called pervasive gaming, that allow existing games to be 
augmented by applications, resulting in a blend of the real and virtual worlds 
~\cite{arango17}.
This virtualization improves the gameplay, making faster and easier to manage. 
Anyway, there is always the need of a master. We belive that, for some 
activities, this role can be distributed to the members, spreading its duty to 
everyone.
