\section{Results}

During GameBank development we have created some metrics in order to gain 
additional information about our application behaviour. In particular, we 
have focused our attention about Bluetooth, creating a counter of the data 
received and transmitted for a particular device. Only the payload transmitted 
has been counted tough, since we weren't able to intercept data communications 
between devices that would have provided better measurements. The metrics are 
stored in a file in a \texttt{csv} format, containing the type of transmission 
(input or output), the quantity of the data exchanged and the type of the 
event in the \texttt{BTBundle}.

\todo{Insert here: the number of test done, a table with the results, how we 
performed the tests}

In conclusion, we can see how the biggest data exchange is during the lobby 
formation. This is due the fact that profile pictures are exchanged and 
broadcated through all the peers. During the match, the traffic is little, 
because the transaction are relatively small, with a size of only 
CHANGEME\todo{Set the average transaction size}. Thus, bluetooth particularly 
fit in this context, since most of the time the data sent between devices is 
quite small.
