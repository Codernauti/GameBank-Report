Applications that interact with real world games (i.e. augmented reality games 
as Pok√©mon Go) are becoming more and more interesting to study, as they enhance 
the gameplay, making it more interactive and engaging. Furthermore, device 
ubiquity in everyone's life enables gamers to interact between each other in 
multiplayer matches more than ever. In this paper, we present GameBank, a

the players, through a well defined and established wireless link: Bluetooth.
