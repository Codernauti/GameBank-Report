Applications that interact with real world games (i.e. augmented reality games 
as Pok√©mon Go) are becoming more and more interesting to study, as they enhance 
the gameplay, making it more interactive and fun. Furthermore, device ubinquity 
in everyone's life enables players to interact between each other in multiplayer 
matches more than ever. In this paper, we present GameBank, a pervasive game 
that distribute the burden of managing money in board games to the players, 
through a well defined and already existing wireless link: Bluetooth.
