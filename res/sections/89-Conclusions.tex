\section*{Conclusions}

In this paper we illustrated GameBank, a pervasive-game for Android, that uses 
Bluetooth as a wireless link to exchange data between players. We have seen how 
pervasive games can make easier for players to enjoy board games. On top of 
that, we implemented a method for distributing master duties, in particular 
regarding money transaction, using a model similar to the Blockchain one.
