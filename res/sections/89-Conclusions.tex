\section*{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}

In this paper we presented GameBank, an application for Android that uses 
Bluetooth as a wireless link in order to digitalize some features of a board 
game. We have seen how pervasive games can make easier for players to enjoy 
board games. On top of that, we implemented a method for distributing master 
duties, in particular regarding money transactions, using a model similar to 
the Blockchain one.

Finally, we have seen how Bluetooth, a popular and well defined standard 
protocol for wireless communications, can contribute in different fields, as 
social mobile gaming/pervasive gaming. Nonetheless, this wireless link can be 
considered an effective technology for carring out future tests in these areas.
